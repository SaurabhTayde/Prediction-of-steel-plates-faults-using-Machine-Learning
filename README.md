Fault Diagnosis (FD) has a major importance to enhance the quality of manufacturing and to lessen the cost of product testing. Actually, quick and correct FD system helps to keep away from product quality problems and facilitates precautionary maintenance. This study evaluates the performances of three of the popular and effective data mining models to diagnose seven commonly occurring faults of the steel plate namely; Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps and Other_Faults.
